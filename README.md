### Hi there ðŸ‘‹ I'm Rohan,

A technophile by heart , I love hacking away at any technology I can get my hands on.


- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on:
	- A web based saas system which will help the next gen small and medium enterprises handle their supplychain and automate it.
	- A mobile app to help organizations communicate around daily tasks and activities, and make collaborative work more fun and easy.
- ðŸ’¡ I am interested in making the world a bit more organized using technology and data.
- ðŸ’¬ Talk to me about Python, Javascript, Design Principles or even the latest trending technologies or languages..
- âš¡ **Fun fact:** I am a huge fan of anime. My favourite anime include Deathnote, No Game No Life and Oneouts.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m working with a small group of dedicated coders whose sole mission is to make the world a bit more organized using technology and data.
